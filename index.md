[NBIS](//nbis.se) provides this course as an entry-level introduction to a wide range of analytical techniques for massively parallel sequencing, including basic Linux commands. We will pair lectures on the theory of analysis algorithms with practical computational exercises demonstrating the use of common tools for analyzing data from each of several common sequencing study designs.
